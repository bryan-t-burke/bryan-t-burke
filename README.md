# Thank you for visiting my profile
My name is Bryan Burke. I am currently looking for Senior Software Engineer and/or Software Architect roles.
You can learn more about my experience on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-t-burke).
If you'd like to review some of my repositories, I would recommend starting with [Mock BSP Project](https://github.com/bryan-t-burke/mock-Billing-Service-Provider/wiki) for system design
or the [MyLibrary](https://github.com/bryan-t-burke/MyLibrary) repository for general coding.

I specialize in crafting innovative SaaS solutions that seamlessly bridge diverse systems. My journey in
software engineering has led me to thrive in Agile teams, where collaboration with testers, customer
operations, and end users has been my compass.

My forte lies in architecting, building, and rigorously testing code to power scalable, reliable, and high-
performance software systems tailored for cloud-based, financial industry applications. I'm dedicated to
upholding coding protocols and standards through meticulous code reviews, continuous integration,
and rigorous testing.

My knack for debugging and resolving complex technical issues keeps systems running smoothly. I'm a
proud contributor to the full spectrum of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), where my
expertise shines in every phase.

My Passion Lies in
Witnessing the tangible results of my work is truly fulfilling. Whether it's implementing new
functionality that seamlessly operates or resolving persistent issues, I find immense satisfaction in the
creative process of devising solutions.

My Leadership Philosophy
My leadership/management philosophy revolves around a goal-oriented perspective. I believe in
meticulously assessing tasks, breaking them down into manageable steps, and delegating when feasible.
Adhering to deadlines is crucial. I often adopt the 'teach a man to fish' approach, empowering
individuals to seek solutions independently rather than simply providing answers.

My Utmost Pride
One notable achievement I hold in high regard is the successful bank user migration project. It
demanded a diverse skill set, and we achieved remarkable milestones within just a year. The project
necessitated meticulous planning, the creation of new systems from the ground up, and the seamless
coordination of multiple disparate teams.

Unique Individual Unveiled
I am a published tabletop RPG creator, specializing in the world of tabletop role-playing games, akin to
Dungeons and Dragons.

defeated. - G.K. Chesterton
